**Dictionary**

📘 Overview
The Dictionary demonstrates the use of Python for creating and managing a data dictionary—a key–value structured data representation that allows efficient storage and retrieval of information.
This serves as an educational example for understanding how dictionaries function in Python and how they can be used to perform operations like insertion, deletion, updating, and searching of data elements.

🧩 Features
Create and initialize dictionaries dynamically
Add, update, or delete dictionary entries
Access data using keys and perform searches
Display dictionary contents in a user-friendly format
Demonstrate common dictionary methods and best practices

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Understand how Python dictionaries work internally
Learn to manipulate and iterate through key–value pairs
Gain hands-on experience with Python’s built-in data structures

🏁 Conclusion
This project provides a foundational understanding of dictionary-based data structures in Python, forming the basis for advanced topics such as JSON handling, data serialization, and API data management.
